# 💫 About the project:

This project is inspired by the Divar website and was built from scratch by me for learning and testing purposes. I developed the entire project myself and tried to make it look and feel similar to Divar.

In this project, users can post ads. To upload an ad, you need to enter your phone number, receive a verification code, and log in. After that, you can submit your ad to the site. The backend is written in PHP, and all user data is stored in a database.

There's also a chat and contact section where you can talk to an AI chatbot built using JavaScript. In addition, there's a support section and a “Contact Us” page — which also includes a JavaScript chatbot that answers your questions and helps you out if you need assistance.

I built and designed this project purely as a way to practice and improve my skills. Later on, after I complete my learning in React and Next.js, I plan to rebuild this project using those technologies to make it even better.
